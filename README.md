Java EE Assignment

An assignment for my Java Enterprise Edition course. I was to refactor and re-engineer an online application (source provided by
Dale Van Heer at Adelaide TAFE). The following was done
* Recreate a database and host in GlassFish with connection pooling
* Fix errors
* Refactor/Re-engineer using dispatchers, tags, system parameters, header/footer and connection pooling.
* Perform testing using JUnit
* Provide java docs
* (Merit) use persistency
* (Merit) Use a stateless sessiion Enterprise JavaBean - NOTE: To simplify the assignment I moved the dispatchers to the business
  tier although I understand that this is not recommended procedure. Normally I would keep them on the web tier.
